# A Feed-Forward Neural Network implemented MATLAB
This is a revision that I made in these days about the <i>Machine learning</i> exam's project I developed during the university one year ago.
I've implemented a <b>Feed-Forward Neural Network</b> and I've tested the ANN on the <i>MNIST</i> dataset.

This code permits to customize the network's structure (number of layers and activation functions) and the learning algorithm used during the training phase because I wanted to give a general approach to the net's usage. I've implemented two learning algorithm, one based on the simple back propagation and another one based on the resilient back propagation. Both of them can be used either during an <i>online</i> learning or a <i>batch</i> learning.
I've also put into this repository three examples of usage.
