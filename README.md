# A Feed-Forward Neural Network implemented MATLAB
This is a revision that I made in these days about the <i>Machine learning</i> exam's project I developed during the university one year ago.
I've implemented a <b>Feed-Forward Neural Network</b> and I've tested the ANN on the <i>MNIST</i> dataset.

This code permits to customize the network's structure (number of layers and activation functions) and the learning algorithm used during the training phase because I wanted to give a general approach to the net's usage. I've implemented two learning algorithm, one based on the <i>simple back propagation</i> and another one based on the <b>resilient back propagation</b>. Both of them can be used either during an <i>online learning</i> or a <i>batch learning</i>.
I've also put into this repository three examples of usage.
