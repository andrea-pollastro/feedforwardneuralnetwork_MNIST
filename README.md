# A Feed-Forward Neural Network implementation from Scratch
This is a revision of the <i>Machine Learning</i> exam's project I developed during the university years which consists in a developing and testing (using the <i>MNIST handwritten digits</i> dataset) a <b>Feed-Forward Neural Network</b> in MATLAB.

This code permits to customize the network's structure (layers number and activation functions) and the learning algorithm used during the training phase. I've implemented two learning algorithm: the <i>simple back propagation</i> and the <b>resilient back propagation</b> (RProp). Both of them can be used either during an <i>online learning</i> or a <i>batch learning</i>.

This repository contains three examples of usage.
